# Introduction

These are the two implementations of the two papers on Bilateral Control in Teleoperation and Time-domain passivity observers/controllers 
in Bilateral Control for Teleoperation task

These implementations are basically done for one assignment and one semester project for the course, Haptics and Teleoperation course 
during my masters' studies. I thoroughly enjoyed studying control in such a different domain. 

# How to run:

The bilateral control implementaion only, the paper presents three different control strategies. The 'which_control' arguments 
takes the values of 1,2 or 3 depending on which control simulation results you require. 

For the passivitiy observer and controler (POPC), the implementation is only done for NO_TIME_DELAY case. Hence the results are quite 
amazing but this is only ideal case. Please set the 'which_control' parameter in the code to run the specific control strategy. 


Thank you
